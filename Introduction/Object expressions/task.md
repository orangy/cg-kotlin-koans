## Object expressions

Read about [object expressions](http://kotlinlang.org/docs/reference/object-declarations.html)
that play the same role in Kotlin as anonymous classes in Java.

Add an object expression that provides a comparator to sort a list in a descending order using java.util.Collections class.
In Kotlin you use Kotlin library extensions instead of java.util.Collections,
but this example is still a good demonstration of mixing Kotlin and Java code.
